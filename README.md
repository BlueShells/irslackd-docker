# irslackd-docker
Dockerized irslackd

Caveats:

* Slack may show you as offline even if you're connected.
* Slack "user responses" come as messages, not icon additions.
* Slack "user deleted message ..." comes as-is, doesn't delete the message.
* Slack sub-threads are somewhat hard to follow.
* Slack channel topics don't appear to be changeable.
* Probably some other stuff
